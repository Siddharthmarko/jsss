        <h3>All Payments are subjected to the following conditions</h3>
        <p>
          Once "Pay Now" - Option is selected you will be directed for payment
          through NET BANKING or DEBIT / CREDIT CARD. You can choose the desired
          payment option and proceed. All credit/debit cards details and
          personally identifiable information will NOT be stored, sold, shared,
          rented or leased to any third parties. Once the payment is successful,
          You will get a PAYMENT CONFIRMATION SLIP and the student has to keep
          the same for reference. In case the payment is not successful due to
          any reason you will get a display on the status of failure in payment.
          In case none of the above two happens, and there is heavy delay in any
          response from the system - if you have not proceeded with payment and
          not given card detail particulars, you may proceed from the beginning
          again and start the payment process again In case you have given all
          the DEBIT / CREDIT card details or NET BAKING authorization for
          payment, and have not got any response, please check with your bankers
          or credit card company and see if your account is debited. If your
          bank account/CC is debited, please don't make any attempt to pay
          again. However, if your account is not debited in the bank, you have
          to make the payment and get PAYMENT SUCCESSFUL confirmation. All Fees
          quoted are in Indian Rupees. The School reserves the right to change
          the fees at anytime. Your payment will normally reach the School
          account to which you are making a payment within three working days.
          We cannot accept liability for a payment not reaching the correct
          School account due to you quoting an incorrect personal details.
          Neither can we accept liability if payment is refused or declined by
          the credit/debit card supplier for any reason. In no event will the

        <h3>Service Provider</h3>
        <p>
          Online Payments of Fees can be made by credit or debit card or net
          banking. These payments are not collected by the School directly but
          by the Service Provider. Once payment is received by the Service
          Provider in cleared funds, the Service Provider will contact the
          School to confirm the details of the successful payment made by the
          Student, or third party making payment. On receipt of this
          confirmation the School will confirm to the Student that the payment
          has been received and accepted by the School. In the event that the
          Student does not receive confirmation within 14 days of making the
          payment it is the responsibility of the Student to check with the
          School that the payment has been accepted. The Student shall remain
          responsible for the Tuition Fees until such time as the confirmation
          as referred to above is received from the School in relation to each
          of these and any outstanding amounts owed to the School.
